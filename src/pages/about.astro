          Hi, I’m William Applewhite — I'm a multidisciplinary artist based in the Triangle area of North Carolina, where I’ve lived my entire life. I studied visual arts at the Durham School of the Arts and then continued my education at UNC-Chapel Hill, cultivating a practice rooted in both local identity and conceptual inquiry. My work explores the increasingly fragile boundary between the natural and artificial.
        </p>

        <p>
          Primarily working with gouache and pen on art board, I examine how technology and synthetic structures both mirror and distort organic forms. Rather than treating nature and human-made systems as opposites, I’m interested in their entanglement—how one bleeds into the other, reshaping our environments and perceptions. I invite viewers to consider how these dualities coexist and evolve, often in tension, often in harmony.
